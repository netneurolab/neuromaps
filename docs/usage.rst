``neuromaps`` aims to provide a set of reproducible tools for working with
and analyzing brain maps (or "annotations").

This user guide steps through the basics of fetching brain annotations and
atlases, transforming data to different spaces, and assessing relationships
between brain maps using spatial null models. If you still have questions after
going through this guide you can refer to the :ref:`api_ref` or ask a question
on `GitHub <https://github.com/netneurolab/neuromaps/issues>`_.
